# DSSE-Learn

This repository consists of example codes extracted from the paper
["A Resilient Deep Learning Approach for State Estimation in Distribution Grids With Distributed Generation"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1155/etep/2734170).

This paper first creates a dataset for distribution system state estimation (DSSE), then proposes a feedforward neural
network to solve the DSSE problem (with distributed generation), and finally identifies and mitigates bad data.

The algorithm requires basic knowledge of MATPOWER, MATLAB, and Python (PandaPower, TensorFlow, and other famous libraries).
